This package provides double integrator control laws, i.e., a function **u**(**x**,**v**) of the position **x** and velocity **v**, which guarantees asymptotic convergence of the position to **0** along trajectories of the closed loop system

```
d/dt **x** = **v**

d/dt **v** = **u**(**x**,**v**)
```
